# EduBadge

## Problem Statement

In the era of excessive competiton, where students are constantly trying to earn new skills and work on different projects, the students need to store their git hub badges, research papers and much more in an  authentic and more effective than conventional method. 
The problem also lies in the user experience and compromise on data security.

## Proposed Solution

EVM compatible chain powered smart contract for to bring the dream of a new-age credential verification to life, for blockchain based solution to make student assets ( git hub badges, research papers more authentic and more effective than conventional methods of submissions). The solution also had to provide an enhanced user experience, without compromising on data security.

To ensure this, we establish Blockchain as the centrepiece in our design thinking (primarily for its immutability and inherent use of cryptography)  bring the dream of a new-age credential verification to life, thus the solution to provide an enhanced user experience, without compromising on data security.

## Functionalities

1. Help the employer reduce costs and time of traditional verification of certificate by providing proof of achievement and membership.
2. Help the institution save time and money for producing certificate papers.
3. Protect the certificate from mutation.
4. Provide lifelong storage.
5. Help Informal learning like online learning, boot camps becomes more secure, trustable and recognized, which is recently unappreciated and short of official certificates.
6. Students take full of responsibility to protect and share their certificates without the need of a central party.

## Future Scope

### 1. Better Interaction
Make EduBadge more flexible and userFriendly improve its interface and also make navigation easier and fun

### 2. Expand UserBase
Create different ends for different types of users(students, intitutes, companies etc)

### 3. Customixable
Increase flexibility so that users can customize their protfolios/profiles according to their need

## Conclusion
Thus we have made an attempt to create a web based application using Solidity Contract and ReactJs as framework to build a platform where students can showcase their works(art/projects/badges/papers etc) and can serve as a portfolio for institutes and companies to evaluate and check for validation/authentication.
